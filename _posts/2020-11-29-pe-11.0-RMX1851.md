### Known issues

### Reporting Bugs
* Don't report bugs if you have any custom kernel or module installed
* Create new issue [here](https://github.com/SamarV-121/android_device_realme_RMX1851/issues).
* Grab a logcat right after the problem has occurred. (Please include at least a few pages of the log, not just the last few lines, unless you know what you're doing.)
* If it is a random reboot, grab /proc/last_kmsg. (Do not bother getting a logcat unless you can get it just before the reboot. A logcat after a reboot is useless)
