![LineageOS](http://samarv-121.github.io/images/lineageos.png)
**LineageOS** is a free, community built, aftermarket firmware distribution of Android 9, which is designed to increase performance and reliability over stock Android for your device.

**LineageOS** is based on the **Android Open Source Project** with extra contributions from many people within the Android community. It can be used without any need to have any Google application installed. Linked below is a package that has come from another Android project that restore the Google parts. LineageOS does still include various hardware-specific code, which is also slowly being open-sourced anyway.

All the source code for LineageOS is available in the LineageOS Github repo. And if you would like to contribute to LineageOS, please visit out Gerrit Code Review.

### Known issues

### Reporting Bugs
* Don't report bugs if you have any custom kernel or module installed
* Create new issue [here](https://github.com/SamarV-121/android_device_samsung_universal7904-common/issues).
* Grab a logcat right after the problem has occurred. (Please include at least a few pages of the log, not just the last few lines, unless you know what you're doing.)
* If it is a random reboot, grab /proc/last_kmsg. (Do not bother getting a logcat unless you can get it just before the reboot. A logcat after a reboot is useless)
* If the problem disappears after running "setenforce 0" from a root shell, grab /proc/avc_msg.
