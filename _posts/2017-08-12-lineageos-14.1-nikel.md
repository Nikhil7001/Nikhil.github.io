## What is LineageOS?
**LineageOS, also known as LineageOS Android Distribution and Lineage (/ˈlɪn.i.ɪdʒ/), is a free and open-source operating system for smartphones and tablet computers
based on the Android mobile platform. It is the successor to the highly popular custom ROM CyanogenMod, from which it was forked in December 2016 when Cyanogen Inc.
announced it was discontinuing development and shut down the infrastructure behind the project. Since Cyanogen Inc. retained the rights to the Cyanogen name the project rebranded its fork as LineageOS.**
