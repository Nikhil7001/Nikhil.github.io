## What is this?
**Pixel Experience is an AOSP based ROM, with Google apps included and all Pixel goodies (launcher, wallpapers, icons, fonts, bootanimation)
Our mission is to offer the maximum possible stability and security, along with essential features for the proper functioning of the device**

* SELinux
* RIL (Data,SMS,Calls)
* VoLTE
* Fingerprint sensor
* WiFi
* Bluetooth
* Camera
* Camcorder
* Audio
* GPS
* Sensors
* Video Playback

### Known issues
* You tell me

### Reporting Bugs
* Don't report bugs if you have any custom kernel or module installed
* Create new issue [here](https://github.com/SamarV-121/android_device_realme_RMX1851/issues).
* Grab a logcat right after the problem has occurred. (Please include at least a few pages of the log, not just the last few lines, unless you know what you're doing.)
* If it is a random reboot, grab /proc/last_kmsg. (Do not bother getting a logcat unless you can get it just before the reboot. A logcat after a reboot is useless)
